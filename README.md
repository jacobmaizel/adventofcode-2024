# 2024 Advent of Code Solutions
--- 

The goal of this repo is to showcase understandable, readable, tested and benchmarked code solutions for this years' advent of code. 

There may be more efficient solutions, but I chose to leave the more clear solutions with some quick optimization wins rather than hyper optimizing the code and ending up with an unreadable plate of spaghetti. 

Feel free to reach out to ask any questions about the implementations or use them to help guide your own solutions. Enjoy!
